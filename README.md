# MinecraftBannedList

A tool to retrieve Minecraft banned list from players' json files on a web server (like [NyaaStats](https://github.com/NyaaCat/NyaaStats))
It works properly on Java 8u171 and Java 10.0.2

I directly get the source code from Eclipse workspace, so... It may not work with command-line or other IDEs.
I'll fix that in the next version.
